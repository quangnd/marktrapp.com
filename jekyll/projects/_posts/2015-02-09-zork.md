This project is an attempt at porting the text-based adventure game [*Zork*][1] from its [original source code][2] written in the [MIT Design Language][3] (MDL) to PHP. More information about this project can be found in the blog post, "[Porting Zork — Part 1: Introduction][4]".

## Installation and usage

Installation is done using [Composer][5] via [Packagist][6]:

```sh
composer create-project itafroma/zork:dev-master --dev
```

At this stage of development, there is no working binary, but you can run tests using [PHPUnit][7]:

```sh
cd zork
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Caveats

The original incarnation of *Zork* was written in the late '70s in a language that has long been obsolete. In order to create a faithful adaptation, the original algorithms, procedures, and program design have been ported without consideration of modern programming principles. Concepts and structures that did not exist in MDL—for example, objects—are not used. This repository should not be considered a paragon of current development practices, but an exploration of a historical moment in game development.

With that in mind, I have made a few conceits:

- Concepts and data structures that existed in MDL but do not exist in certain, more modern languages (e.g. enumerable types in PHP) are replicated as best as possible while still maintaining the spirit of the original code.
- Namespacing of functions (and classes when they are necessary) is used.

## Roadmap

You can follow along with development on my blog in a series of posts I'm calling "[Porting Zork][4]". This project follows the [Semantic Versioning][8] standard: the first numbered unstable version, 0.1.0, will contain a running executable (though not a complete game). The 1.0.0 release will be a complete port.

## Acknowledgments

The original *Zork* was designed and [implemented][9] between 1977 and 1979 by [Tim Anderson][10], [Marc Blank][11], [Bruce Daniels][12], and [Dave Lebling][13] working out of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science Dynamic Modeling System ([MIT-DMS][14]).

I am using the reference manual *The MDL Programming Language* by S. W. Galley and [Greg Pfister][15] to facilitate the porting process.
